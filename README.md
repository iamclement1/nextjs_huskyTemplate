# A Huskty Template

This is a project template designed with Next.js, a popular React framework for building modern web applications. The template also includes several development tools and configurations to streamline the development process.

1. Next.js: Next.js is a framework that simplifies the creation of React applications by providing server-side rendering (SSR) and other helpful features out of the box.

2. Husky: Husky is a tool that enables you to set up Git hooks, which are scripts that run before or after specific Git events (e.g., commit, push). In this template, Husky is configured to facilitate automatic execution of tasks before committing code.

3. lint-staged: lint-staged is a tool that allows you to run linting and formatting tasks only on the files that are staged for the commit. This ensures that only relevant files are checked, which can speed up the development workflow.

4. Prettier: Prettier is a code formatter that automatically formats your code according to a set of predefined rules. It helps maintain consistent code style across the project and reduces manual formatting efforts.

5. Commitlint: Commitlint enforces commit message conventions. It ensures that developers follow a consistent commit message format, making it easier to understand the changes made in each commit.

6. ESLint: ESLint is a popular linter tool for JavaScript and TypeScript code. It helps identify and fix common coding errors, enforce code style guidelines, and improve code quality.

The primary purpose of this template is to provide a pre-configured development environment with essential tools and configurations. It aims to streamline the setup process for projects using Next.js, making it faster to start development while maintaining consistent code quality and adherence to commit message conventions. Developers can simply clone this template and begin working on their projects without worrying about setting up the development environment and hooks manually.

## Getting Started

First, fork the repository, then clone the repository:

```bash
git clone repository-url
```

 Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
